        <h1 class="html"> HTML </h1>
        <p class="html-text"> I learned so much in HTML since it is the foundation or skeleton of the website. HTML means Hypertext Markup Language. Without this, <br>
            we cannot build the website itself. I also learned how to make a table based on what I want, use numberings and formats. HTML only <br>
            has the basic structure of a website such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, and inserting pictures. It also has some <br>
            functions that can help you organize your website. You can move the pictures from left to right, resize the pictures and color <br>
            the background and text. You can also use formatting tags and such to add some simple style on your website. However, that is <br>
            too simple for a website since that’s only the foundation of the website. </p>

        <h1 class="css"> CSS </h1>
        <p class="css-text"> That is why we have the CSS or Cascading Style Sheet. CSS serves as clothes or fashion on our website that is why
             it is called <br> cascading “style” sheet. With this, we can organize more of the content of our website compared to HTML that we can
             only <br>use right, middle, and left when aligning something. Using CSS makes my website more pleasing to the eyes of the viewers<br>
             and it looks so organized and aesthetic. Throughout the lesson on CSS, I also learned putting some animations like hover on<br>
             the text contents of my website. CSS puts styles and animation on our website that really helps people to easily navigate<br>
             the website while having designs.</p>

        <h1 class="js"> Javascript </h1>
        <p class="js-text"> If we have the skeleton and style of the website, of course we need something that can make an additional function on our website.<br>
                            That is when the javascript will come in. Javascript serves as a language to make effects on our website. It is pretty much everything <br>
                            for a function. You can also do math using this type of programming language. During this time (06/02/23), I learned some functions in <br>
                            Javascript. To make it easier to understand, Javascript is pretty much variables and functions. That is almost all you need to put some <br>
                            engaging functions on your website. With Javascript, you can also put time and date if you want to display on your website. I’m still <br>
                            learning the basics of Javascript since we just started studying it last week.</p>
